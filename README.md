    What We Do
    
    At RateMyHeart.com, we analyze and review restaurant dishes based on their potential effects 
    on key health concerns, including:

    ✔ Cardiovascular Health – Are the ingredients heart-friendly, or do they contribute to 
      high cholesterol and blood pressure?
    ✔ Obesity & Weight Management – Is the dish balanced, or is it packed with excess calories, 
      unhealthy fats, and sugars?
    ✔ Cancer Risk Factors – Does it contain processed ingredients or harmful additives linked to 
      increased cancer risks?
    ✔ Other Non-Communicable Diseases – How does it impact diabetes, gut health, and overall well-being?

    Our Heart Rating System offers a clear, at-a-glance assessment of how a dish supports—or harms—your health. 
    Alongside expert-backed reviews, we provide insights into nutrition, ingredients, and healthier alternatives, 
    ensuring that every meal you choose aligns with your health goals.

    At RateMyHeart.com, we believe that food should not only taste good but also be good for you. 
    Join us in making mindful eating the new normal!
